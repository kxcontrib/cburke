<h1 id="install-j7">Install J7</h1>
<p>Install the J7 system from <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/stable.htm">J software</a> (it can be installed anywhere). Then follow the <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/System/Installation/J701/Gtk">install Gtk</a> instructions.</p>
<p>Check that the J Gtk IDE works before continuing. It is best that GtkSourceView is also installed, as this gives the syntax coloring. You can tell from the window appearance, or in the J terminal:</p>
<pre><code>  IFSV_jgtk_ 
1  
</code></pre>
<h1 id="install-qconsole">Install Qconsole</h1>
<p>The qconsole distribution unzips into directory qconsole. This can be anywhere, but the default location is under the q home, i.e. ~/q/qconsole. If you use another directory, make corresponding adjustments in startup scripts and base.cfg.</p>
<p>The subdirectory structure of qconsole should be preserved, except that subdirectory dev has examples, and can be deleted or moved elsewhere.</p>
<p>All configuration files are stored in subdirectory config, with file extension .cfg. This directory also has files with extension .dat, that are autogenerated by qconsole. Edit base.cfg as appropriate (defaults are for linux/gnome).</p>
<p>Qconsole connects to a q server using ipc. By default, the q server is assumed to be listening on port 5101. To use another port, change the Port definition in base.cfg. If the required server is not running, qconsole will try to start the server, using the QServer command in base.cfg.</p>
<p>Qconsole requires that the script lib/startup.k be loaded on the server. If the server is on the local machine, a command is given to load this script. Otherwise, the script is saved as qconsole_startup.k on the server, and then loaded. The latter requires appropriate permissions on the server, failing which startup.k should be copied to the server and loaded before qconsole is started.</p>
<h1 id="startup">Startup</h1>
<p>Start the q server first, then try qconsole.</p>
<p>Once everything is working, experiment with having qconsole start the qserver if not yet running.</p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>Edit then run the shell script qconsole/qconsole.sh to start the IDE. It should change to the qconsole directory, then call jconsole with the qconsole script, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/q/qconsole
~/j701/bin/jconsole -jprofile lib/qconsole.ijs &quot;$@&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can create a Desktop Shortcut for it. If run as an Application in Terminal, the gtk terminal window will show and this can be useful for debugging. Usually you want to run as an ordinary Application (i.e. not in Terminal).</p>
<h2 id="mac">Mac</h2>
<p>Edit then run the shell script qconsole/qconsole.sh to start the IDE.</p>
<p>The QServer command in the config is for Linux and needs to be updated for the Mac.</p>
<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>Edit then run the shortcut qconsole/qconsole to start the IDE. The Target should be like:</p>
<pre><code>C:\701\bin\jconsole.exe -jprofile c:\q\qconsole\lib\qconsole.ijs
</code></pre>
<p>The Start in directory should be the qconsole directory, i.e. <code>c:\q\qconsole</code> in the above.</p>
<p>Normally the shortcut would be run minimized. If set to run as normal window, this will show the gtk terminal window. and this can be useful for debugging.</p>
<h1 id="subdirectories">Subdirectories</h1>
<ul>
<li>break - used for break processing. You can delete any files left here.</li>
<li>config - user configuration, in files with extension .cfg.</li>
<li>dev - example projects. This can be deleted or moved elsewhere.</li>
<li>help - all help and documentation</li>
<li>lib - other system files</li>
<li>snap - script and project snapshots.</li>
<li>temp - temporary directory used by system</li>
</ul>
